# Elanat

Elanat was created to be a reliable system in .NET and an honor for .NET programmers and can be compared to other systems under PHP and JAVA.

Elanat is a free and open-source CMS-Framework based on ASP.NET Core. Elanat version 1 was created based on ASP.NET Standard; in a short time, Elanat migrated to ASP.NET Core; therefore, Elanat version 2 is based on ASP.NET Core. Elanat uses the [CodeBehind](https://github.com/elanatframework/Code_behind) framework; this framework is an infrastructure whose executable files are aspx that run on ASP.NET Core.

The ASP.NET Standard version of Elanat is fully copied in the repository below. The README.md file of this repository gives you information on how to migrate Elanat from ASP.NET Standard to ASP.NET Core.

### The most powerful .NET system

Elanat framework is one of the best systems on the web. There is also a built-in CMS in Elanat core. Elanat uses an [CodeBehind](https://github.com/elanatframework/Code_behind) infrastructure MVC architecture that is not related to Microsoft ASP.NET MVC.
This system is very powerful and very large and it benefits from a very modern structure that allows you to create up to 20 new add-ons for Elanat every day.
The wonderful structure of Elanat is in a way that it interacts with 8 types of add-ons, all of which are components, and the component itself is also a component. In the admin section, all component lists and other add-ons are displayed by the plugin add-on.

### Big project with the best technologies

There are nearly 600 executable aspx files, 56 DBMS tables, 560 stored procedures, more than 600 XML files and nearly 70 JavaScript files in Elanat core.

At Elanat, we have introduced several new technologies in web-based systems; Some of these technologies include the following:

 - Server-side independence
 - add-on-oriented
 - Socket-connector
 - Library switcher

We also used several high-level technologies:

 - Structure box and list item
 - The separation of the template from the style
 - Content name value
 - Variables in the content template

In many cases, the Elanat system is better than Microsoft SharePoint, Drupal and Liferay.

### Add-ons

According to the list below, There are 8 different types of add-ons in Elanat :

 - Component
 - Module
 - Plugin
 - Patch
 - Page
 - Fetch
 - Extra helper
 - Editor template

Component: Component can have different definitions or meanings in each system. In the Elanat framework, add-ons that only administrators role have access to are called components. plugins, modules, and the component itself each have a component management page.

Module: Modules and plugins are a kind of add-on that can be displayed in any part of the website; add-ons in Elanat framework that being able to display, provide separate management for the add-on, are called modules.

Plugin: Add-ons that are purely visual and do not have a management page are called plugins.

Patch: After installing this add-on, it creates a series of changes in Elanat framework and has no page to display.

Page: The page is a type of add-on that is displayed in the site section of the Elanat framework. The page can be static or dynamic.

Fetch: Fetch is a add-on that combines database queries with HTML tags and can be displayed on any page or add-on from the Elanat framework. This add-on can be run without displaying the values and make changes in the database only after running.

Extra helper: Extra helpers are add-ons that only showed in admin section of Elanat framework and only administrators access to this add-ons.

Editor template: Editor templates add-ons are part of a html page template; each of the Editor templates helps content writers use a ready-made template to create pages faster and more organized.
